## Function Documentation
search_github(keywords):

This function is an async function that searches GitHub using the provided keywords.
It uses the aiohttp library to make a GET request to the GitHub Search API, passing in the keywords as a query string parameter.
The function returns the JSON response from the API as the search results.
insert_results(results):

This function is an async function that inserts the provided search results into a PostgreSQL database.
It uses the asyncpg library to connect to the database and create the search_results table if it does not already exist.
The function then iterates through the results and inserts each one into the search_results table, using the keyword as the primary key and the total_count and items as additional columns.
If a keyword already exists in the table, the function updates the total_count and items columns with the new values.
The function closes the database connection when it is finished.
search(keywords: KeywordInput):

This function is an async function that handles the search request made to the API.
It uses the pypeln library's pmap function to apply the search_github function to each keyword in the keywords list in parallel.
The function then creates a list of tasks using asyncio.create_task to perform the search for each keyword.
It uses asyncio.as_completed to iterate through the tasks as they are completed and append the results to a list.
The function creates a dictionary for each result with the keyword, total_count, and items as key-value pairs, and passes this list to the insert_results function to insert the results into the database.
The function then creates a SearchResult object for each result and returns the search results as a list of SearchResult objects.


## Other endpoints to add
Here are some ideas for additional endpoints that you could add to your API to support venture capital firms in sourcing deals and analyzing projects:

A endpoint for searching for companies or projects based on specific criteria, such as industry, location, stage of development, or financial metrics. You could use the GitHub API to search for repositories that match the desired criteria, or you could use a third-party API or web scraping to gather data from other sources.

A endpoint for comparing the performance of a specific company or project against others in the same industry. This could involve gathering data on key metrics such as revenue growth, customer acquisition costs, or employee retention rates and presenting the data in an easy-to-digest format, such as a chart or table.

A endpoint for tracking the performance of specific companies or projects over time. This could involve gathering data on key metrics such as revenue, user growth, or market share and presenting the data in a visually appealing format, such as a line chart or bar graph.

A endpoint for finding potential partners or customers for a specific company or project. This could involve searching for companies or individuals with complementary skills or products, or those that are active in the same industry or market.
    - Notes:
        Funding history: You can use the "relationships" endpoint of the API to retrieve information about a company's funding rounds, including the amount of funding raised, the investors involved, and the valuation of the company at the time of the round.

        Market and industry data: You can use the "categories" endpoint of the API to retrieve information about the market and industry that a company operates in, including the size of the market, the trends and challenges facing the industry, and the competitive landscape.

        Product and service offerings: You can use the "products" endpoint of the API to retrieve information about a company's product or service offerings, including details about the features, pricing, and target market of each offering.

        Team and leadership: You can use the "people" endpoint of the API to retrieve information about a company's leadership and team members, including their roles, experience, and education.

        # USE THIS FUNCTION WITHIN THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE TO CALCULATE SIMILARITY METRICS
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION similarity(text, text) RETURNS float AS $$
        SELECT 1 - levenshtein($1, $2) / greatest(length($1), length($2))
        $$ LANGUAGE SQL;

        # HOW TO MAKE THE FUNCTION BETTER WITH NLP
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to improve the functionality of the search_for_partners() endpoint in several ways. Here are a few examples of how NLP could be used to make better predictions about potential partners:

        Keyword extraction: You could use NLP techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings to extract relevant keywords from the company's project descriptions and industry information. These keywords could be used to improve the accuracy of the search by more accurately matching the company's projects and industry to potential partners.

        Sentiment analysis: You could use NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment of the company's project descriptions and industry information. This could help you identify companies that have a similar sentiment or focus to the company you are searching for, which may be more likely to be good partners.

        Topic modeling: You could use NLP techniques such as topic modeling to identify the main topics or themes in the company's project descriptions and industry information. This could help you identify companies that are working on similar topics or in similar industries, which may be more likely to be good partners.

        ## FEATURES TO ENGINEER
        As a data scientist working with venture capital analysts, you might want to consider engineering features that can help them better understand and evaluate potential investments. Some examples of features that could be useful for this purpose include:

        Financial metrics: These could include revenue, profit, growth rate, cash flow, and other financial indicators that can help analysts understand the financial health and potential of a company.

        Industry benchmarks: Comparing a company's financial metrics to industry benchmarks can help analysts understand how well the company is performing compared to its peers.

        Market size and growth potential: Understanding the size and growth potential of the market in which a company operates can help analysts gauge the potential for future success.

        Competitor analysis: Analyzing a company's competitors can help analysts understand the competitive landscape and the company's position within it.

        Customer satisfaction: Measuring customer satisfaction can help analysts understand the quality of a company's products or services and the level of demand for them.

        Technology and innovation: Analyzing a company's technological capabilities and innovations can help analysts understand its potential for future growth and success.

        Management team: Evaluating the experience and track record of a company's management team can help analysts assess the company's leadership and potential for success.

        Risks and uncertainties: Identifying and assessing risks and uncertainties facing a company can help analysts understand the potential challenges it may face and make more informed investment decisions.


        # notes on predicting market growth
        market growth for the industry or project you are interested in. This could include data on revenue, profit, market size, or other indicators of market growth. You could also consider using industry benchmarks or industry-specific indices as a proxy for market growth.

        Once you have collected this data, you can use it to train a machine learning model to predict future market growth. For example, you could use a supervised learning algorithm like a random forest regressor to learn a relationship between the features in your data (such as revenue, profit, market size, etc.) and the target variable (market growth). You can then use this trained model to make predictions on future market growth based on new data for the features.

        It's important to note that the accuracy of your predictions will depend on the quality and relevance of your training data. To improve the accuracy of your model, you may need to experiment with different features and algorithms, or collect additional data to improve the model's ability to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable.
